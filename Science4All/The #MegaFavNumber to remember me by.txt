so thanks to the great james grime and all the leading math youtubers like freeboo and braun matt parker and numberphile there's currently a big math youtuber coming out where each one of us reveals their mega 5 number and well to be honest i don't really have a mega 5 number i'm not that kind of a person i mean all of the numbers of my friends i guess but since i'm a ship and i do want to participate i came up with a slightly different question namely if i had to sign my tombstone with one number what would that number be what number would i want to be remembered for and well today at least it would be this number right here so what is that why would i even care about this number well you know how mathematicians are actually very narcissistic and they just wanted to prove this one theorem that they will be eternally remembered for well i am a mathematician and i have done things i wouldn't mind being eternally remembered for in fact as of today at least the one thing i would most want to be remembered for is probably my first ever book on probability theory and it's amazing applications to an extremely diverse range of fields so i guess i would like to be remembered for this book well of course my name is already on the book but my name is one of the most common names in the world i mean les mueren huang have you ever tried to google it there's a gazillions of us i mean mom and dad seriously did you want my life to be differently private so perhaps i should sign my book with something that really identifies me and not some other linguine wrong well cryptography has a trick for this it's called electronic signature now i won't go into all the details of how this actually works other videos have but briefly i do have a pair of so-called public private keys my private key is well private and only i know it or rather only my computer knows it i mean it's quite a big number but my public key is public in fact you can check it out it's just right here and so using a cryptographic protocol called rsa along with other techniques i've asked my computer to mix the pdf of my book with my private key to leave a signature that only i can generate or rather that only a computer with my private key can generate now i should say that this does not prevent some malicious users to claim that they're the ones who actually wrote the book by providing their own signature by mixing the pdf with their own private keys if i really wanted to stamp this pdf as being the product of my work it would be actually a good idea to also upload my signature on multiple reliable large-scale blockchains for instance but i guess that youtube video is the next best thing but what my signature does allow is that by combining my signature with public key anyone can now check that i vetted this version of the book if they see a version of the book and if they want to verify that it is the version that i have written using my signature and my public key they can in other words my signature allows to authenticate the right version of the book this is why this number which for cryptographic reasons could not have been produced if it was not for my book and my private key is very much a sort of signature of my biggest achievement this is why this signature is the big number that this video and perhaps my tom stone though i still have doubts should i really do this anyways this is what this video is all about
