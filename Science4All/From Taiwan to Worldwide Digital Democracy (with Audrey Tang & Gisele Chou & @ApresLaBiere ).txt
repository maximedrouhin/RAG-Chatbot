yeah so so hello everybody I'm very happy to be here to uh to uh interview uh odong and and jelo with je for uh so we'll be discussing uh mostly the the the recent book plurality that came out uh and uh all things around the digital democracies and how to to improve the use of Technologies for society um and maybe just to get started uh you can present yourself yeah okay hello everyone I'm Audrey Tong I served as taiwan's digital Minister since 2016 uh to 2024 uh so I just graduated uh this may and on the day I graduated May 20th uh I published a book along with Clan wild with jelle with many people and the book is public domain you can download it from plural it.net it has no copyright and in the book we described how Taiwan started from very low trust like in 2014 only 9% of people trust the government to when we graduated uh it was like more than 60% so how to rebuild trust using technology for democracy that is our main contribution in the book okay and jizelle can you present yourself as well and and your role in in the project okay uh hello everyone I'm G I'm very happy to have this opportunity to introduce some um my uh mostly uh contribution is like the co work and assistant or to contribut some M chapters I think that is a very special experience because we can uh through these world and uh to let more people to understand understand what happened what inside values is about taiwan's experience yes the M inversion was just published this month as well oh nice congratulation uh and because uh obviously Le and myself we read the book the past weeks and one big topic of the book is what is plurality so I guess you could spend a few words explaining uh your theory behind this plurality concept sure so uh plurality is a observation that in our society there's more and more differences more and more conflict and before when we see conflict we only see like protesting and the other side try to put it out uh but now we see collaboration is possible making bridge is possible so instead of uh seeing fire on the ground and put it out we now say oh is there oil uh we can drill for energy so it is a way to turn diversity and a conflict that started from diversity into collaboration and so more concretely speaking it is for example on social media instead of sorting by people hating each other or shouting at each other we can sort by which notes on community notes uh can Bridge more distances making sure that people who have different ideas can all see uh that oh here are some things that we can all live with and this is how in Taiwan for example in 2015 uh we talked with Uber drivers with taxi drivers with many passengers and so on WE cross sourced uh the agenda that led to the legalization that uh took care of the rural area the urban area the uh workers rights as well as the new business model of uber so everybody wins but this is only possible because we are not afraid of conflict and can use technology to turn them into co-creation and so for that technology to work we need to trust the people uh with not just broadcasting messages to them but broad listening listening across many differences so plurality means collaboration across diversity yeah interesting and as well uh I don't know if I remember well in your book but you you you say somewhere that plurality is something that is a resource to uh co-create or to grow and when you use this resource it actually uh become uh less and less available so you have to recreate and be be careful and pay attention to to keep that plurality alive in order to be able to uh to um to produce growth with it growth I mean like social growth like that exactly yes because as I mentioned uh when we turn the energy from protesting to demonstrating yeah demonstrate means to make something that works better so not just this is bad but also what is better but when we discover something that really is better uh like during the pandemic uh really the demonstrators found a way to do contact tracing better and we switched to it uh but then there's less uh conflict in the society so now you have to find new ways to see the next conflict and then turn the next conflict into co-creation nice um and and you have a nice illustration in the book as well uh saying that plurality is at the Crossroad of three different approach of plurality oh yes uh so there are three different thinkers yeah who all use the term plurality yeah we have Hanah arent who say plurality is the basic human condition that nobody acts as an individual alone but rather are always groups of people uh in action so this is one thought it is that the society is not composed of atomic individuals nor is it a single uh Society like a single abstraction but rather it is many intersecting groups so that's Hanah uh and then we have Daniel Allen who says that in the society uh how connected the society is depends on how much you're willing to face people who are different from you who may have conflict from you and then to make bridges across those differences so that's Daniel Allen and my idea of plurality is that the way to build those bridges should be uh the role for technology so especially digital technology because in Taiwan shoue means both digital and plural so we can use digital technology to amplify those bridges instead of like more antisocial form of social media that burn those bridges or destroy those bridges uh and we have many researchers well including yourself showing that the more input that people uh contribute uh like the different um um contributions can weave together and once people have a kind of group self picture seeing how the people's preferences are then it leads to more understanding and this is how technology can foster plurality and this is very different from Singularity which is not about people talking to each other but about a giant robot in the sky or something like that giving us Ubi or something so it is a very different view of Technology it is a view that says technology like my eyeglass is here to help us see each other better it is not to replace uh humans yeah I think plurality itself the book is an example of plurality right can you tell us about how you wrote it yes so over the course of two years uh we started from an outline and then we posted it online say free of copyright anybody can Fork it uh and then there are several chapters like there's one called usan uh that talks about how history but taian history is very complex and many people are not uh particularly happy about uh any particular way you talk about it so you get people saying oh this is wrong uh or saying that we do not accept this view uh but instead of waiting until publishing and then get bad reviews we ask the reviewers to contribute their way uh to tell the taian story so uh jelle for example uh worked with uh many co-writers uh and weave those differences together so that when you see the Taiwan chapter it shows many many many different perspectives and each perspective was uh instead of um a complaint a protest after publishing it was somebody who would have complained uh being invited into the co-creation process yeah the book is on on GitHub and anyone can make uh some some po request and for instance I don't know if you're actively searching for like a translation maybe in French but people could actually go to to the GitHub and and propose the the ti version uh and we're in Japan now the Japanese version is almost ready okay and you can contribute new chapter as well in the printed book um there is no chapter on learning uh but uh on the website you can already see the chapter on learning and jelle was the main author uh contributed after the publishing so so you mean we can we can write a chapter on tonos for example yes exactly if you want to uh write about trol you can choose to write it as one new paragraph in a existing like augmented deliberation or the media chapter or if you think it's worth a new chapter you can write a entire new chapter yeah I think we will just for the story like when you first told me this I told you that I tried this uh so I have this book called smart poof as well but you told me that the the error that I made was to make it uh CCB and yours is like fully CC zero so like no attribution required yes because you publish it after you finished uh the first draft but we publish it when we have nothing we have just that's also interesting uh and in the book there is uh something that comes uh back a lot and uh with Le we are uh really happy about it because it's a it's something that we thought a lot about when we wrot our book as well it's like the the the two dangerous path for Technologies one which is really centralized and the other completely decentralized like and and then to go back to come back to an arent and what you just said it's just like this two Vision one which is really really Atomic and individualistic and one which is really uh one one system for all uh yeah can you explain this two path and uh what should we do and what you suggest that that we do in order toh to go in the middle the middle path yes I would say that most people uh are already on the middle path uh because we naturally use technology in different context if we work is with a bunch of people if we uh go to um a hobby uh or a club uh singing together or something that's another group of people if we go hiking different group of people my family different group of people and so on so it is very natural for people to think ourselves as the intersection between all those different peoples different groups um however in many of the design of the technology everything is condensed together uh and then uh you're flattened into like one single Facebook or one single Twitter uh or things like that and when the relationship gets flattened uh in this way then you ended up having a lot of strength rers a lot of people who trolls and so on uh who are not part of the conversation destroying the context of the conversation uh and so I think many people now instinctively uh go to the more privacy preserving the more group oriented like signal uh and other communication uh Technologies because they want to preserve the context uh of their different groups without being uh a monol uh like everybody on the single platform uh and so one so I think it is the natural way uh and um whatever people say oh the singularity is near or the AI will rule everything and replace every people and so on I think they miss and not very attractive Miss at that it doesn't agree with our everyday experience yeah and I think like in tonos we use for example Discord and I think Discord is such a platform as well because it has a lot of context because everyone knows each other like it's not like everyone goes onto that platform so like we have like the whole historic of all the conversation and it's exactly what you say like people are coming back to this kind of platform and uh now for example I prefer to go to that platform uh instead of Twitter to get some information because I have the context and and it adds a lot to the conversation the Integrity the contextual Integrity yeah we talk about that uh in our book uh and so if the technology rules us it's called technocracy yeah right but if we can uh code up a new way to use technology and steer technology then it's called democracy so technocracy democracy very different yeah and and and that's something that you talk about in the book as well is like the example of uh Taiwan which is at the Crossroad of three different strategies uh the European strategy the US strategy and the Republic of China de um strategy like can you explain on that because I I love as well the metaphor of the tectonic plaque and that Taiwan is at the middle of them and then then you take a bit of the three strategy and you apply them in Taiwan so can you explain yes that yeah the so-called People's Republic of China or the Beijing regime uh as we all know uh they use a lot of uh money to develop infrastructure yeah uh but they do not allow um anyone else Civil Society journalism and so on to steer the direction of infrastructure it is very top down yeah uh so that's One Direction uh the European one is more about saying what not to do uh right you cannot uh violate human rights you cannot violate privacy you cannot violate uh the importance of interoperability you have to use type c uh so that is another uh way to think about things uh is very instructional um and uh in the US uh they believe in entrepreneurs so they believe in the private sector thinking of new ideas Innovations uh and if there are some social issues they have Charities uh they have nonprofit sector not the government uh to first start responding to it so it's again a very different role uh but in Taiwan we combine these because Taiwan is literally caught in a tectonic plate between the uran and the Pacific so they bump into each other uh every day there's three earthquake small ones sometime in Taiwan so we uh get earthquake but because of that usan the top of Taiwan 4,000 meter high grows every year uh and so we took uh all those different ideas and we say yes the government should invest in infrastructure but we should invest in digital participation infrastructure so that when people through those DPI can see how to steer the technology how Uber comes to the society should be integrated how AI comes to society should be integrated how social media come to society should be integrated um then all those good ideas get government funding uh to be public infrastructure so it's like airports trans stations uh that work through interoperability which is the European view but we make it not in a way that's stop down but rather asking Civil Society to come up with small demonstrations and then we amplify it with say presidential hackathon and many ways that we introduce in the book and finally like the US uh we have a very thriving ecosystem so in Taiwan even though we have a open-source collaborative factchecking co-act uh system in a civil society but many companies use this resource and develop new services on top of it so you have message Checker uh from gole look uh you have a robot uh that you can invite to your uh chat group and that scan each message for thisinformation for fraud and things like that you have Trend Micro and so on they're all very big very successful private sector company but they tap into the shared infrastructure that is open source so the digital public infrastructure enable private sector entrepreneur so they don't have to re reinvent the will so the Civil Society the people steer the technology the government invest in the infrastructure that scale the technology and the private sector delivers new Services Innovations so we have the different ideas from the different jurisdictions um like you mentioned uh there is this uh steering from the EU there is this investment from the public sector like Beijing uh and there is entrepreneurship like in the US but they're layered in very different ways so so Taiwan is historically and GE geographically plural it's really like you took all these uh perspective different ones and you put them in uh in into like a better Society like it's it's really like the the the symbolic what that you describe and you try to make in the book plurality it's really like what Taiwan has done with these three perspectives yes the name t Taiwan comes from the C Ty and that means a converging Place yeah a place where different features converge together okay so yeah if it was one country which could uh write such a book as plurality it would be a bit of Taiwan B Taiwan I mean yes that's correct um and another thing is like uh it made me think because you you talk a lot a lot in the book about uh how the web uh is born and uh a lot about this guy called leider or something Li lier lier yeah yeah and as well like it reminds me like uh when I listen to you and this three perspective it's as well why the web was well thought a little bit because you had this uh Democratic infrastructure thought you had this government uh trying to invest in that arpanet and DARPA and you had as well the the private sector uh doing some Innovation and making things uh better and new technology and everything so you had this mix of these three perspectives and that's why the web number one or number two was like Wikipedia was kind of successful according to you before it went to hell uh as as planned as well that's what you explain in the book yes um yeah because this uh theme of the public infrastructure yeah was what made internet possible yeah the internet started as a public infrastructure yeah the problem was that the governments and the Charities did not consider open source like Wikipedia and so on uh these public goods uh as essential infrastructure critical infrastructure so they did not invest sufficiently uh into keeping it and so what happens is that that um now we do not have a single way to identify each other online except going through Facebook or Google we don't have a single way of paying uh each other online except going through PayPal or something like that right and so a lot of the So-Cal web three movement is about red decentralizing uh these uh different functions uh but had we consider the essential service of personhood Association payment Commerce and so on if they were all thought as digital public infrastructure that all governments should invest in together then we will not have this hell uh that you did just describe where a few incompatible um um uh companies uh monopolize our attention and so on so just compare like the early internet when you use email maybe you use you use uh some mail provider I use another mail provider but our email can always communicate uh to each other because it's interoperable uh or when we did uh RSS I work on the RSS and ATM um formats you can publish a podcast and you can listen to the podcast using any software yeah but if you now post on Tik Tok you cannot view anything uh on Tik Tok without using Tik Tok so it is very very different it is not an infrastructure view it is now a lockin view a war Garden View yeah absolutely uh and to come back to Taiwan as the crossroad of these true perspectives uh when we talked about it with Le we thought uh the sunflower movement in 2014 which you participated in uh is as well again a picture or an illustration of this Crossroad as well we like the 2014 revolu sunflower Revolution is exactly uh the these three perspectives coming together that is correct the sunflower movement uh started as a demonstration by students because at the time the parliament was trying to FastTrack a trade service deal with Beijing that will open up for example our 4G infrastructure to Huawei and to ZTE and so on uh which carries some uh cyber security systemic risks it will also open up our media industry our publishing industry and everything uh and so because the students did not like that they were not uh consulted and anyone wasn't consulted uh and so they occupi the parliament when it was empty so it was nonviolent uh and they demonstrated how they would like it to be uh deliberated using the MP's uh office using the MP's is H as a way to demonstrate uh and uh with live streaming uh everybody can see it is nonviolent so when the police came surrounded the parliament um everybody who saw the live stream came also to the parliament to counter surround the police uh so the police did not uh attack uh and so it kept that way for three weeks and over the three weeks every day there is a readout of the consensus that was reached the previous day we worked with 20 NGO uh to have deliberation on every aspect uh labor environment things uh cyber security things like that of the trade agreement so by the end of three week the head of the parliament W Jinping the speaker say okay it seems like you have reached something good and I and so it was a victory uh it was a very rare occupy that ends with a victory yeah we should have that in France with the of the prime minister right now yeah I think there are two things that are very interesting what you said the first is that you managed to find a consensus um like right now in French politics uh even within a party it's very hard to come up with with a consensus exactly how did you do this yeah um well I mean in France you also had a citizen assembly right you had a citizen assembly on the right to end on own life uh and that citizen assembly was quite uh successful from what I read about it but it took a lot of time it took a lot of curation it is not just you know debate uh like uh one debate or two debate it is a very careful process uh and so you need a professional facilitators to design this process fortunately nowadays with AI you can do a lot of summary or translation very easily using AI now but the process itself still needs to be designed and defined uh but I think citizens assemblies are getting more and more uh people aware that there are ways to facilitate such conversations not necessarily to a consensus maybe just to something we can all live with uh but that is good enough that is better actually because it retains some Conflict for the energy for the next use well in order to be successful it needs uh the politician afterwards uh to listen to what the citizen assembly citizen has decided and that's one of the topic in Fr which is which was quite hot it was like for the climate change uh assembly uh they decided 150 laws or project of laws and the the the most a lot of them were not applied afterwards and that's why like this kind of assembly in France uh was a a semi Victory because the the process worked but afterwards when it leaves like the the power of the assembly it comes to the the the the the legislative power in France like it was not applied yeah in Taiwan when we had a alignment assembly when it comes to information Integrity online the top three agreed statements more than 85% agreement post deliberation uh almost immediately became law uh it passed a few weeks ago so it's only like two months three months between the deliberation and it became law and so you need uh a fast turnaround because if you don't then people feel they have wasted their time exactly so I think the great thing about this process is you can start small you can start with a city you can start with a district you can start with Adon M uh a a region uh but uh it doesn't need to be always National if you try it on a smaller scale usually it's easier for the city council or the mayor uh to promise uh than the president yeah I think the other thing that is quite special about the sunflower movement is how much importance we give to digital Technologies as a way to empower the people can you yeah speak more about this yes uh so that was the very beginning of live streaming uh so in 2014 uh twit uh our YouTube live or Facebook live was just beginning uh and so it was very uh easy for people to just dial in uh and feel that they have a say U so although we have half a million people on the street there's even more people online and people from all the different time zones uh care about the Occupy Movement so for the first time we can include people who normally will not go to a deliberation um and so like my grandparents they're now uh my both grandmas are over 90 years old now uh my parents over 70 uh so for those senior people it's very difficult for them to physically participate in an occupy not very easy uh but if you can do a video stream like what we're doing now because in Taiwan we have Broadband as human right so anyone can have unlimited data connection uh and a very good upload speed no matter where you are and so if there are ways to include people's Voice through online means but to aggregate those ideas into something that is happening uh in real life in real space so making a hybrid uh setting then a lot more people will care about what's happened in the space like the occupied parliaments compared to if they only can read it on TV because in TV it already happened yeah right so you you cannot do anything about it but with the live stream if you see something if you have a voice you can immediately say oh I I want uh this new idea to develop in this way and there are ways to take those ideas from the live streaming into the occupied Place yeah I'm just curious like uh did you like was there also like cyber attacks or like uh the China the People's Republic of China try to like mess mess with the result yeah we uh of course face uh seever attacks all the time uh in fact uh just last year our subc cables the physical cables connecting the Mau islands and Taiwan were cut uh in one week both were cut uh by uh one uh cargo ship and one fishing vessel uh flying the Beijing flag uh and so they said they accidentally dropped anchor accidentally kept moving I sure it was an accident I'm sure it was an accident yeah so we have to invest in resilience uh and plurality is again important so we work with uh the uh French Luber uh sees Global uh but we also work with the UK uh one web U many different satellite providers to make sure that even when the subsid cables are cut we can transmit uh our video to the world uh and we also convinced not just Google and Microsoft but also um I think uh early next year Amazon will all set up four regions in Taiwan so that there's redundancy and even when the subsid cables are cut the video conferencing within Taiwan can stay uh in Taiwan and so the plurality of providers ensure that we're not locked in into any single vendor like starlink or whatever but we have a choice when it comes to the cyber attacks uh and mitigating against the cyber attacks yeah like I was concerned when you said that you wanted your your grandparents to to to participate in in in the live streaming uh one concern that I would have is that maybe they can be replaced by fake accounts or there would be fake accounts playing the roles of your grandparents trying to to hack the discussion oh yeah uh so like in Taiwan uh we sent 200,000 SMS m to random numbers in Taiwan so only taiwan's uh phone number can receive them and if you're not among the uh numbers that receive uh from 111 the official number then you cannot participate in this live stream uh and so there are a very strong authentication uh usually using SMS um and because in Taiwan you need to have two photo ID to get a SMS number and if you want try to get 5,000 SMS number uh then uh the anti- money laundering office uh will be after you very quickly and so it is not easy actually in Taiwan uh to get uh fake identity through SMS numbers so that's usually how we uh tackle the problem of impersonation I think I want to I just think something is about uh what sharing that is a mean like the Taiwan democracy and the internet they are like yeah they're the same year right so we we got our first presidential vote in 1996 uh and the Wild web also got very popular in 1996 so uh when we first started democracy already there are several attacks already there are ways uh to try to uh game the system uh and so uh we are very used to this kind of threat uh and we design our politic process or Democratic process not with the political people and the technical people thinking separately but they're literally the same generation of people yeah good the song for movement is is the same because the internet open so the democracy is more open so people can see that and people have the chance to say and to make a difference Choice yeah in other occupy movements maybe you have the activist uh holding the core uh and the technologist can only help on the periphery uh to uh like live stream or something uh but in the sunflower Movement we work very very closely together that is another difference yeah and like what you describe like make me think about like the concept of co-evolution and in Taiwan it's like democracy and web Co evoluted to co- evoluted together so like in our old democracies it's really hard for us to integrate Technologies because we we have everything set since I don't know 250 years or something and now it's really hard to integrate new technologies but when you born and democracy started almost I mean started with technology then it might be not not easier but you've done it it's like this cool yeah more naturally interesting I mean the voting system in the US is not very modern it's a very old one design for horses exactly um another concept we wanted to talk about because you you you you you deal with it and you talk about it extensively on the book is like the the freedom of speech uh and and you say like in a world where information is scarce freedom of expression uh freedom of speech is extremely important uh if uh you you want the society to function the slightest voice that could talk about a subject in a new way and that is censored is a tragedy for society uh but nowadays information is not scarce so we have to question and we have to integrate ourselves what we do what do we do with this uh freedom of expression uh what do we transform it do do we do we want to eradicate it or do we want to invent something else so what what what do you suggest in the book yeah I mean uh we talk about cyber attacks but uh there are also information attacks right exact so those attacks uh they do not need to censor nowadays uh because censorship works when information was scarce when you have just a few TV stations a few newspapers then of course you got go after them and censor them but now everybody have internet connection uh and attacks uh are not about censorship it is about polarization attacks so it will amplify the noise uh on both sides of the extreme and because they're very loud uh so it uh makes a conversation impossible uh and then they can say oh democracy only leads to chaos uh but they they helped uh to sew the seed for the chaos to amplify the most polarized voices and so in a sense it is not uh censoring anyone all the expression is still there but but it doesn't reach any people anymore because people's attention are hijacked by the most extreme voices the polarization theack yeah right so in uh order to fix this problem we need to sort differently instead of sorting by so-call engagement or how many people click on it uh impulsively we need to sort uh by bridge building like in community notes on x.com or on the YouTube notes or on Pol many systems we now have a different way to say uh if you're very loud uh and you convince only one part of the ideology then your message do not flow to the top your message only flow to the Top If You Can Build Bridge across ideologies across people with different thoughts uh and this is very good because then uh the top stories you see are more likely to bring people into the mood of conversation and this is uh the true freedom of expression uh it is to be free from those information polarization attacks on the Integrity of the information ecosystem itself yeah it's an interesting way to put it uh like right now our freedom of speech is being uh erased by U by attacks that are like putting us to silence in a way yeah and and for the one who didn't read the book yet um the the the thing about censorship as well is like when you when you when you want to censorship or want to to apply you you have to do it in accordance to a law or a concept but when you have like polarization attack or Cyber attack like the the the the the messages that are like Spread spread like all over the web are not falling against this kind of FLW for example so you can have an attack with just True True News that's not like a fake news article like lies or be yes it's just very strong opinions like it's it's it's it's it's it's legitimate opinions the the only thing is just like it's it's it's not balanced with like the real opinion in the population and then it makes us more polarized than what we are actually um and and that's a central concern like that you put in the book and that we have as well of digital democracy is like to improve deliberation because who is going to choose what community not is going to uh be elected and to go uh on the front page for everyone Twitter or any platform so you you you suggest to uh improve uh digital uh deliberation like you say in the book we had in the past three ways of doing deliberation one is sortition which is like this citizen Council for example uh election when you have to elect people Administration like technocracy for example when you have people um chose by Merit in order to decide for for like an organization or an institution and you suggest in your book to augment uh this digital deliberation and you have like three ways of doing it like can you can you explain like how to this deliberation yes as I mentioned uh when we sent 200,000 SMS to people anyone can reply with their ideas and uh previously it's impossible to process all these ideas yeah uh very quickly but now with AI with language model uh like in the uh Tokyo uh governmental Governor's um election there is uh a uh candidate that use talk to the city to assemble uh every suggestion uh and visualize it and so it is now very easy actually to visualize now with the shared visualization uh we chose uh a lot of people 450 people to have deliberation online uh and they're in rooms of 10 so 45 different rooms uh but each room is not facilitated by human the room itself is the facilitator so the chat room uh will nudge you if you are too quiet uh speak more you would say uh or you can disrupt uh but only for five seconds and then it mutes you saying you're too dist distracting and so it is like a moderator but it's entirely machine uh and because of that uh people can move on from one idea to another idea in a way that maintains the deliberation quality uh and when 450 people deliberate simultaneously uh then the machine can also uh very quickly see this idea and that idea in different rooms uh they add together into a better idea and so in the planner session those can be read out uh to the people so people discover oh these different rooms have different ideas so basically this kind of augmented deliberation yeah means that we can involve tens of thousands of people simultaneously in a way that costs almost nothing uh and that was not possible uh before even like three years ago that was impossible uh and so with this new technology we can both reach more people but also have higher quality of conversation yeah another thing you you you discussing in this uh section is uh like the community notes and police uh can you describe this a bit more to to us yes so Community notes uh is a way for people who look at the Tweet uh or X posts and want to add some context to it and many people can contribute to the context but only the notes that are broadly agreed by people of different opinion will get attached to the tweet and once it's post posted on the post then even the original poster like Elon Musk cannot take it down so it become like part of the post so people understand oh this is not the entire uh world uh you must balance that with this context and this is important exactly as we say because often those uh posts on x.com are legitimate opinions so it's not like you can take it down because it's illegal but it's often very one-sided it's missing very important context and so Community knows is a way to add those contexts back now YouTube uh now in the US also started this uh service uh and um like meta have threat on net and they're now trying a different sorting way to also uh sort first the threats posts that appeal to a wider range of people and they're also in fediverse uh so that you can use uh mtoon or some other way to try your own sorting so x.com YouTube meta they're now all looking at these new kind of tools because they also don't want to be the place where only people hate each other right they also want to be the place where some discussion actually happen um yeah and it made me think about like our conversation uh that we had just before about like information is scarce and uh and now like it's not the case anymore because uh one important uh way to improve deliberation according to you is to leverage and organize existing media content and exchanges it's not only creating better content or creating another type of content it's about organizing the exist once yes uh and just like your own experiment uh with the Trans interface it's not like you did all the video by yourself right they're all existing video uh it was just arranged uh differently and this is important because otherwise you face the bootstrapping problem you will have to convince all the creators to switch to your and that is not very useful uh but if you can reuse existing content but just separate the publishing layer with the curation layer and you work on a better curation layer then that solves almost all the problems uh the great tragedy of the social media was that the curation was not free so you were everyone were trapped into the Publishers default way of uh curation and they often curate only for the advertisements uh only for the impulsive buy uh and that leads to the current hell but if you can Elevate the curation into its own service then that solves almost all the problems immediately so that would be your your suggestion for the recommendation algorithm like it's like what you call creation layer like we have to you have to we have to uh to make the creation layer meaning the recommendation algorithm uh Freer but what what would you recommend like H how how would we uh create better creation layer and recommendation algorithm for platforms such does YouTube like inspiration from Community notes for example yeah YouTube now has Community notes uh as well so they will uh keep trying to roll it out but you can also uh think of for example in the EU you have the digital Market act that says uh WhatsApp have now uh its own protocol called signal protocol uh but it used to be you have to install WhatsApp to send message to people with WhatsApp but now the EU says no uh you must interoperate so now IM message RCS uh Google message whatever they now must be able to send message to each other you cannot force um people to install WhatsApp anymore they are no longer uh um like monopolizing uh this messaging uh space uh and so you can think of it not just as messages or group chats but also if you now think uh YouTube uh with this content posting it must also uh allow for different thirdparty curation layers uh then that changes the game of course the digital Market act doesn't say that currently but you can imagine a version of digital Market act that says that that says uh now YouTube must be able to work with people who bring its own recommendation algorithm its own curation layer that is one possibility another possibility is to say um like in the US uh YouTube can get away with their moderation because uh the US has section 230 uh they have a law that says the social media companies uh are not liable uh for the choices they make in moderation but if you change that law and say um yes uh it can moderate of course according to like uh the illegal contents take down whatever but uh if it elevates some voices uh then it needs to be liable to the voice that it elevates so volume control like recombination algorithm unless it's open it's interoperable unless people bring it themselves otherwise if the platform uh only provide a default and do not allow the choice to change the default then it must be liable to the harm that is done uh by this default algorithm that's also a possibility so whether you think of it from the interoperability angle or from a liability angle you have uh some ways to make the curation layer its own layer so either interoperable or liable but you have to choose yes exactly okay it's interesting because I think interop operability is a big discussion topic in France especially with the con numeric in France and well liability is also an important factor but like for instance with the uh genocide of the hingar in Myanmar it was a big topic U um yeah uh but yeah yeah I I think like somehow you you've been talking a lot more about recommendation algorithms than you you've had in the book like I feel like there was not a lot of that much discussion about this uh like was it like intentional or yeah we talk about that in the media chapter but uh we did not spend many pages to talk about the details uh it's all in the footnotes so in a sense we're now just expanding the footnotes reading interesting foodnotes um yeah one thing like the uh next logical question uh for the discussion is um we talk about like uh we should recommend differently the creation and everything uh it all comes down uh to people on the end internet voting in some way for what content should be uh put forward so and and you talk uh more extensively about the vote in the book um so digital democracy and voting so you have a section uh like cons like which is which is all about voting so what is like the the best ideas according to you when it comes to digital voting yeah in uh po for example uh or Community notes um there's up vote there is down vote uh and that is already very different from many democracies uh and uh in polus and in community notes you can up Vote many things uh but now in voting uh usually you can vote only for one candidate again very different uh and so in the book we talk about even more advanced form of voting like quadratic voting and so on uh that makes it even easier for you to express the intensity of how much you like something but all of this uh is easy to implement there are now many places already implemented approval voting or uh down voting or quadratic voting and so on all it takes is a different imagination uh thinking about voting as ways to get more input from the public and so the more signal you get the better um and so I think we can start start by voting for budgets or voting for priorities uh or for petitions uh because for voting for people uh as you say many places have 200 years of tradition very hard to change that political parties uh but if you have participatory budgeting uh or some citizens initiatives or presidential hackathon these are the ways that was not there 200 years ago and most of the voting there takes place online anyway so it's easier to introduce new forms of voting in this digital native uh new Realms and really interesting and one thing that like when we talk about like historical context and everything and one thing we we we talk about in our book is about the difference between uh something called volition and preferences like shortterm choice and long-term choice and um I I was wondering what you think about that difference because like in the old democracy like for example before the voting on Sunday day you you will cut all the media for 48 hours for people just to think about what they're going to vote like just not to react and not to vote instinctively but really really trying to think and that's something which is really important according to us when it comes to digital democracy is trying to gather this long-term and well-formed opinion of the people yes that's why we need to put like 10 people in the same video call uh and to make sure that they all listen to each other so you speak but you spend nine more time listening uh and that gets people into a different mood uh I mean we can literally get those 450 people each individually uh voting but then they would just instinctively go to the place uh that they their first thought is yeah but after listening to nine different people most of them actually change their attitude because they can see from different perspectives so this is the importance of uh spending more time listening broad listening is more important than broadcasting anybody can be a broadcaster now but it doesn't mean that the opinion you broadcast is good it's just your instinct uh if you can broadly listen at least listen to nine other people before making your uh decision uh then it gets people into the mood of a strong preference that is also societal so it's a preference that's good for the community not just for themselves in the short term yeah it was very interesting what you said about uh so iolis high dimensional voting like instead of voting on a few items you vote for for Many Items uh at once like I have colleagues who like to point out that uh in France you vote only a few bits per year in average and that's a lot less than your your bandwidth that you you can use um very low very and and very interesting also I completely agree with this that we have to think are voting Beyond just candidates in politics and we have to to think that there's a lot of decisions to be taken in in democracies and you would want all of these decisions to be more as Democratic as possible uh so that why we need to to elicit uh votes on on many uh different topics now now this leads me to to another to a line of research an emerging line of research called like on on algorithmic Representatives like the idea is that if you have to vote on many things instead of voting yourself for too many things timeconsuming it can be hard like you would construct a model of your preferences and then have this uh voting is this something you've heard of considered yeah yeah uh and it is uh nowadays not that hard to train such Advocates so in a sense if you already have a good idea of what Audrey Town would think um then when we put people in the room of 10 uh to deliberate maybe nine of those 10 people are actually robots um synthesized uh from uh the uh authorized copy not deep fake if I authorize it it's not def uh my digital twin um but uh the question is whether interacting with the digital doubles in this way can still get people into the mood of listening into the mood of deliberation if people can then this is a great technology right because it means that you can almost always get into a deliberative context without waiting for other nine people to go online you can have nine algorithmic uh Advocates uh to talk with you uh and then uh if you engage in many many such sessions then you can also have your own Advocate trained based on your interactions uh so it's almost like a bootstrapping process so I think this is a very interesting line of research uh and essentially for the like nature or river or forest or Mountain uh animals uh future generations for many uh stakeholders that are currently uh no voice right um You Need to have advocate for them anyway uh but instead of just one uh scientist on the board of a company as uh advocate for the nature maybe that scientist can also have a co-pilot uh and that co-pilot is a uh Advocate trained uh using machine learning using actual natural satellite image or some measurement data uh so I think um both in the co-pilot form and as well as in The Advocate form these are very useful uh Innovations and we need to try them out on smaller scale and make sure it actually works uh before making it larger scale yeah I think one big issue is robustness and but yeah I think this is something we we do instinctively when I go when I have to go for lunch with with je because sometimes I have to uh I know I have a model a mental model of what he likes to eat vietnames food always and so I use this to make of course a more democratic decision without actual voting by your inner plurality you have pluralis in your own mind yeah but yeah it's really interesting because uh tell me uh three of you if I get it wrong between tool and what you say orre that we we should do about the broad listening it feels like me for inos it's about broadcasting the choice of everyone so so trying to to listen to everyone choices and when it comes to but but we could just broadcast the choices of people which who had only narrow listen that is correct which will which will be like insufficient so in a in a way we have to make sure that people actually yeah broadcast and and Broad vote for every video that they think it's it's a good video to to vote for but in a way we have to make sure that they before that broad listened to different perspectives in order to make sure yeah like they in a mood of accepting different perspectives yes and not just like their instinctive Choice like oh yeah I love this video and really I should recommend that video and yeah but did you broad listen to 10 video about that subject before you say that yeah or a Snippets or summaries or something like that yeah yeah I think one idea we have in the future is to have some sort of community notes on on on on T as well so that when you're voting for a video you have the context given by a broad Community that's great look forward to that I just have to ask the developers to to work a bit harder um in the book you and uh you talk about a lot about the gfm you know General Foundation model and uh yeah it's it's it's it's obviously something which is uh really big like the the past two years like in the in the media and everyone talks about it and it's really interesting and and fascinating in a way uh but the thing is like we have like a lot of thing that can go really wrong with generational Foundation model and what would you recommend like or what could we do to maximize the chance of the good usage to spread because you have as well uh pornographic deep fake you can have uh a lot of misuse and dis disinformation and cyers scum uh so so it's it's a it's a technology but like I have the sensation somewhere that right now I I am afraid more than I am uh excited by gfm yeah how we balance for many people uh the ability to manufacture any video any uh um any painting uh any photo um I mean before we have digital photography uh like uh 100 years ago 200 years ago uh all we have are paintings um and people know paintings are fake even though if uh they're realist paintings of course we know the illustrator could have uh drawn anything right uh and so you do not uh automatically trust what is in the painting you trust someone because they are a journalist because they're a researcher because they have a code of conduct because you know the um system that they're working in and so on so we trust uh based on the source not based on the content so it was actually quite um abnormal in the past few decades that we trust a video just because it looks real so in a sense deep fake just goes back to the old Norm uh with paintings um like we don't trust anything by default uh and uh it makes it only trustworthy if we have trustworthiness in the journalism in the academic in the rigor of the practices uh that we do uh and so I think this is uh a new Norm we have to switch to like in Taiwan uh if you do not digitally sign the advertisements then it will just assume that is fake um right so that is the new Norm we need to quickly switch to because if we do not exactly as you say it creates more harm uh than uh it creates the good do do you think it's possible for our psychology to adap to that Norm I mean if I'm a young teenage girl of 13 even if it's my new Norm not believing you you see your fellow classmates yeah or the people you know post uh videos of thems and the face the body proportion uh is totally not what's uh actual right because now they all use filters software that change uh the phase the body proportions everything and so you you grow up with such technology and it's not even deep fake it's cheap fake right yeah okay I got that yeah I understand yeah so you will not assume that it is just because you see it in a video is true because you have too much experience with filters now because you you grew up with it so then you get used to it and everything but if you if you do it to someone who is 60 years old for example maybe he or she would be more challenged right exactly which is why we need to pre-b buunk uh not debunk uh so like two years ago I deake myself and send it as an advertisement uh to everyone saying look how easy it is now to deake yeah my concern is that it's still not that easy even for young girls who are growing with this Technologies I know that there's a I mean there's a lot of research showing that there's a lot of mental health issues with Instagram and Tik Tok and so on and uh and using gfm one of the concerns is like the use for pornographic deep phase which can lead also to psychological traumas um like are you hopeful with respect to this or how do you see this yeah I think then but that is a different concern right yeah uh the concern we talked about was about impersonation or about faking my grand grandparents or something like that so that's another thing right now you're talking about the recommendation algorithm showing them uh things that uh make them doubt themselves or raise anxiety uh or create uh un um unnecessary expectations uh on their body or things like that and of course all these are very harmful uh but to fix that I think language models can also help uh like Google jigsaw has the perspectives API that can use language model to analyze each message to see whether it is harmful or whether it is um pro-democratic whether it builds Bridges uh by being more Curious by having more constructive personal story Affinity uh and so on uh and so in a sense uh if each of us have a small language model a co-pilot that help us uh to run the curation to have the filtering will also really help if each and every usse can steer can train this kind of co-pilot uh that mediates like my iglass that mediates how we see the world uh more clearly uh so I'm uh reasonably hopeful if we solve the problem of publishing and curation being too close if we can separate into two layers then people will naturally choose the kind of curation layers that are better for their mental health okay so so seeing that recommendation algorithms are extremely important yes uh that it is as important as like browsers right if you have a browser that keeps pushing advertisements on you you just switch to a different browser because a different browser can still view the same websites yeah yeah I understand like we have really to focus on the creation layer as we try to do with donos yes exactly oh you are the experts I mean we happy we happy to realize that what we do is kind of important very good enough yes um yeah we because we plan to do an hour uh discussion to in know not to take up too too much of your time uh yeah we wanted as well to to ask you like what what are your next projects we heard about like that project Liberty and such projects so yeah we would like to to hear about about where we can follow you next sure yeah I joined the project Liberty Institute as a senior fellow so I'm helping them to figure out uh what are the best uh technological underpinning if you want to separate the curation layer uh with the publication layer uh and they already uh work with uh some uh platform like miwi uh that starts to implement uh this kind of different uh decentralized social network protocol okay so uh the uh the team uh funding project Liberty is now also um talking with um the ideas of the people's bit uh of Tik Tok uh and obviously I'm now speaking personally not as a project Liberty representative uh but uh I think it's quite exciting if Tik Tok can be uh brought into this new way where posting on Tik Tok do not actually automatically determine the recommendation algorithm of Tik Tok if we can have a very healthy ecosystem of Tik Tok curators uh and curation layers uh then the experience of Tik Tok will not be so shortterm uh so time consuming it may actually be a tool uh for learning more together about the world uh and so I think bringing more uh mainstream platforms like Tik Tok into this new world where publishing and curation are different layers I think this is one very important Direction interesting uh and last question to conclude like in the book I like when uh you talk about seeds and uh the theory of change that you develop because yeah we talked as well about theory of change in our book and it's it's a fascinating question for everyone who wants to uh to to have a systemic impact uh so how to invest my time and my energy uh for some seeds that I find uh maybe are going to be good for the word and you say okay you are the the the web three Community seeds which have some advantages against or in coordination with the ecosystem like Taiwan which is as well a seed like a more political Nation Nation seed uh and what what would be your the best community web three based seed uh that we can invest time or look or observe in the next in the coming years what are the best yeah well I I mean we have the plurality Summit in August 8th uh just to talk about this very topic right ah nice yeah so feel free to pay attention uh but uh in in short I think um there's a lot of action now on the idea of programmable cryptography so it's like web 3 but without the need of blockchain uh they can use the same Technologies developed on the blockchain like zero knowledge or multiparty computation and so on but use it in every day uh like with email with websites and things like that so that people can experiment with those decentralized listening and so on without relying on any particular blockchain so this blockchain free web 3 world was programmable cryptography that is I think an important seed because then it carries the U initial Promises of zero knowledge privacy preserving computation but it takes it away from the blockchain and into the world uh that we uh all live in uh so I think this is a space that is worth watching okay nice ex very interesting uh yeah thank you for your time it was uh really nice to talk to to you great yes uh it's usually when we meet in real space uh in high definition uh keeping it up using two Dimension is easier because in my mind there is a threedimensional you right we have a three dimension memory of each other yes yeah yes exactly H so it's very good to catch up in two Dimension you're welcome thank you very much it was excellent and hope we'll see you uh we'll follow you and we'll see hopefully digital democracy will prevail and we will help definitely uh and keep up the good work live low and prosper yeah bye bye bye
