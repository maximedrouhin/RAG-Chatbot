so i'm absolutely thrilled that my first book which came out two years ago in french is now out in english as well it's called the equation of knowledge and it's been published by crc press and you can of course find it on amazon and other non-websites now having a favorite book is i guess kind of having like a first child even though you might have a favorite it's not necessarily nice to say it out loud but i'll be honest with you right here this is the most fundamental book i've ever written and probably the most fundamental book i will ever have written yes because it arguably addresses the most important question of all think about it what is the most important question there is what is the most fundamental question of all questions is it is the roman hypothesis true or what is life perhaps or are we alone in the universe or what are the fundamental laws of physics or does god exist well i would argue that there is a much more important question than all of these questions combined and this more important question is how to know yes because if you can answer the fundamental question of how to know then you can use the answer to this question to answer all the other questions as computer scientist ray salomonov one of the iconic figures of the book once said in science my interest was more in how things were discovered than in the contents of the discoveries the golden egg was not as exciting as the goose that led it and this book is not about the golden egg it's about the golden goose that lays all of the golden eggs of science it's about how to make sure that a given goose will be laying golden eggs and it's about how to verify that a given egg is indeed golden arguably this is the most important questions of all now traditionally we tend to associate this to epistemology and to the history of science and in this book you will indeed find a lot of discussions on the great philosophical ideas of pope or hume and on how einstein challenged newton how goodl upset mathematics and how darwin revolutionized biology but all of this while interesting is not the heart of the book the heart of the book is a central claim that has long been controversial but is becoming more and more consensual at least within the philosophical community and this claim is that the right way to know the correct approach to thinking about the world is to follow as carefully as possible the fundamental rules of probability as laplace argued over two centuries ago this bold and fundamental claim is sometimes known as probabilistic thinking or bayesianism in particular bayesianism strongly relies on a fundamental theorem of probability theory known as bayes rule because it was first introduced by english mathematician thomas pace crucially the book argues that bayes rule should not be thought as a mere mathematical curiosity instead it is arguably the fundamental rule to follow to achieve inductive reasoning which corresponds to inferring probable unobserved mechanisms out of observed data or as laplace would put it base rule is the one way to compute the probability of causes given the known events it is the way to move from observations to general reliable theories this is why i called it the equation of knowledge in the book i list a large number of theorems and empirical evidence from the james cox theorem to the bayesian brain hypothesis that strongly suggests that any deviation from the laws of probability inevitably leads to sub-optimal if not self-contradictory conclusions the book does defense the superiority of pure bajanism however unfortunately these laws of probabilities are computationally intractable meaning that they require unreasonable amount of computational power our computers and our brains simply can't be pure bayesians we must then resort to approximations this is the starting point of what the book calls pragmatic passionism whose aim is to be as faithful as possible with respect to the laws of probability despite finite computational resources i then present the current state of the arts in the science of pragmatic bayesianism which is one of the most exciting current research ever especially given the advent of machine learning and big data and finally i illustrate all of these with a huge number of examples from lawsuits to medicine finance and cognitive biases to really motivate you to check out the book i would like to conclude this video by reading the conclusion of laplace's 1814 philosophical essay on probabilities he wrote if we consider the analytical methods that the theory of probabilities gave rise to the truth of the principles it relies on the certain logic that demands its application to solving problems the public utility goods that is built upon it and the extensions it has received and can still receive given its application to the most important questions of natural philosophy and political economics if we then observe that even in things that cannot be reduced to computation probability theory allows the most reliable insights to guide us in our judgement and that it teaches us to steer away from the illusions that often mislead us we shall see that there is no science more worthy of a meditation and whose results are more useful end of good
