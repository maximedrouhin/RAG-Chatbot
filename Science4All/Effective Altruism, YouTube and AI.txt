as a hair already so today I'm going to give first a first introduction to effective altruism so I don't know how familiar you are with the ideas but it's going to be like the first part heartful now we're just going to present the key ideas and hopefully say things that are not too controversial within the effective altruism community and then we'll be discussing whilst things that are not that discussed in the effective altruism community but I think well there should be more discussed so it's going to be about YouTube in particular so let's start with effective altruism so it's well two words that usually don't go together like we can't you think that effective has effectiveness has to do with I don't know like companies and something I got which is like the sort of the opposite a purely from altruism but these two words actually come nicely together actually they come nicely together on this equation right here which is my new effective altruism hat so I'm going to put it on to do this talk now first I'm going to talk about altruism let's start with perhaps the word that's that simpler now altruism so I don't you I haven't tested hope it's going to work this one doesn't work sorry I can give you some nope huh can I get this sound I've tested it quite something my life is really eat like I there are people who aren't starving in the world [Applause] [Applause] so this is the next type from the TV show really really shows some of the ideas of altruism in general I guess like the fact that we're living quite well here especially like in Switzerland especially here at EPFL in Switzerland and somehow at the other end of the world there are people suffering and so on and it seems like we like could be doing something for them by lowering not that much or live standards now this this argument can be put much more to the extreme like so there's this argument by by Peter singer who's one of the key leading figures in moral philosophy in general and particular in effective altruism where he he argue that we actually have a huge moral duty to people in need basically because we're driving like a society I don't have Beauty but like I'm living quite well and and honestly like I could be giving so much more than I am giving especially given that I don't give it that much and like more generally like each other's try to end sex if you I guess your parents are like people who are well-off living in working in the industry here I in in Switzerland like we were very well-off and just with a small amount of money we could make a huge difference to lives of many people especially in developing countries because over there of course $1 has much more much greater impact than $1 here in Switzerland so this is the twist part like their desert claim that I could make and not going to dwell too much on this which is the fact that today altruism is more important than ever before like it used to be in the past that it wasn't clear what you could do to really improve the lives of so many people and in fact you could argue that if you were back in the 18th century like the best way to improve the life standards of most people was basically improving the steam the steam engine and like just improving technologies to improve the life standards of everyone arguably this is no longer that much of the case today like we were quite well often they're all actions that we can take that can have a much greater impact than they used to be another reason why altruism is becoming more important than used to be is because we can afford it you wasn't really the case before like if you look better back at the 18th century like most people were not that sufficiently well off to be untwists how do you base no longer the case like in developing countries like most others are quite well-off and we can afford to be more twist now so this is the a twist part of of effective altruism it's not the part of screenshot view of interest to me because what is bit like well we should do more for most bit more people right it's the kind of thing that's that probably you've heard a lot the interesting part of effective altruism that the one that really makes me fancy thinking about this let's say is the affective part the idea that well the key idea is really that that not all good actions are equal there are some actions that are much better than other actions and we should think about this and undertake the actions that have a much greater impact especially if they require the same kind of resources if I have one dollar to spend it's probably better to spend this one dollar on actions that are going to have a huge beneficial impact on on many people now it will straight this so there's this example that Peter symbiote likes to give like for instance one I twist move you can do one well very odd twist action you can take is to give money to to train guide the dogs for blind people it's very odd trees like nobody would blame you for this but the thing is that in order to train wonderful one blind person you would have to invest a lot of money like the training of the dog is estimated at thirty thousand dollars for one dog and I think if the the thing is that with the same amount of money you could do a much bigger impact on so many different on so many more people so typically does this disease cost called trachoma which makes a lot of of children in developing countries it's mostly in Africa blind so these kids are who our victim of victims of trachoma their blinds and the thing is that we no cure for this and the is not very expensive it's estimated at less than $100 so with $30,000 what you could do is give one dog to a blind person that will help him or you could cure the blindness of 300 kids in developing countries and it seems that if you know this if you have this choice and if you have thirty thousand dollars to invest somehow it feels wrong to be giving it to the guide dog when you could be doing so much more Google that's where is the key idea of effective altruism is that some goods have much greater beneficial impact on others and we ought to do them rather than those that are good but not sufficiently good compared to alternatives so that's really the basic idea but can be pushed into more extreme and more counterintuitive conclusions so I studied with this example because I think we can all agree that curing the blindness of 300 people is better than giving a guide dog to one blind person but you can push it to the extreme where it begins to be a bit counterintuitive so for instance in his book Peter Stiller argues that giving money to arts is but a particular to artistic institutions like the music the Museum of Modern Art is not only not very addressed like not very effective in Toma of altruism was actually bad that's a very weird conclusion to come to you and so very good conclusion because we tend to value arts we tend to think that giving money to arts is going to improve our artistic the art in the con in the city for instance which is going to improve the everyday life of people who enjoy this kind of piece of art and this is true right indeed people are happier in cities were there are more arts but the question that is asked is not is it good but is it better than what could have been done otherwise and the alternative to giving to MoMA is not giving to mama simple as that the thing is that if you're not giving to mama what do you think other is if you give to mama then your donations will not be taxed and you you're going to have advantages in terms of taxations and so by giving too much vu it's as if you were playing paying less taxes so this is amounts of money that Delta that don't go to into the States or the governments that can be used for instance for education and stuff like this and so although there's a non non-trivial calculation to be done here and in his book Peterson he argues that the mood that you doing by giving to mama is not going to do a lot of good why because like mama is going to invest it in construction construction maybe a new path part of the museum and some people are like millions of people are going to enjoy it but it's not going to add a huge benefit to their lives and you can sort of try to quantify how much good it is compared to say saving lives now for instance you can ask yourself would I like to actually in his book here Peterson do compares this to to blindness the question he asked is how much time of blindness would you trade for one visit of the mobile and this is an answer that has a tag how you can come up with some sort of answer like probably if you're going to be blind for a year it's not going to be worth it like personally I wouldn't agree to be blind for a year if like I wouldn't agree to visit the MoMA if I have to be blind for a year afterwards it doesn't sound like moot rate for me but like I would agree to go blind for one minute to visit the mobile perhaps even like a few hours maybe not too many I was but like that is a trade-off here and if you try to quantify it you can find out the optimal amount of money like the trade-off between how much you should give mama versus other kind of charities and this is really the idea of effective altruism modular is to try to quantify all these sort of things of course it's difficult task and we're not going to all agree on how to quantify different things but according to a senior this is a calculation that we should at least try to do and a lot of effective altruists have tried to do this for a lot of things that don't seem that easy to measure ahead of time marginally it's important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of any more action is very hard to estimate it depends on a lot of things and they are usually hidden costs like if you're giving in to something this is going to have consequences that are very hard to anticipate ahead of time and it's even harder because we are not very good at knowing about the world so this is an extra in the next track from the TED talk given by Hans Rosling which is let's listen to it so try to have an answer you team and reporter the next question in the last 20 years how did the percentage of people in the world who live in extreme poverty change extreme poverty not having enough food for the day did it almost double the dream a more or less the same what did it have a PRC now answers you see best from national disasters in the world you can see from this graph here from 1900 to 2000 in 1900 that was about half a million people who died every information of the floods earthquake the technical action whatever no drums and then how did that change we also get minor on the public in Sweden this is how they at the Swedish public answered breakfast 50% for chicken double 38% said it's more or less mistake 12 7 and half this is the best data from the dissolves the researchers and it goes up and down and it goes to the second world war after that it's not so fun and it keeps falling and it's down to much less than a half the world has been much much more capable as that they kids go back to protect people from this you know sweetness [Applause] sweet [Music] so yeah that was very difficult to know but the world as it is right now this is easy questions like is the world as it is right now and if we trying to think about effective altruism we want to improve the world and so we have to talk about how the world is going to be in the future which is even harder and here we worse than than random it's it's quite unbelievable and so the conclusion of this is really something to keep in mind that I think I think you I'll twist learn the hard way I guess is that you shouldn't trust your gut your guts don't trust you that's that's one of the key messages because you have a lot of intuitions about the world that all that depend on poly the media's you're reading and there are lots of things that are extremely misleading in this and even if you read a lot of quality later because I'm sure like the topic of Ted is reading a lot of very top quality newspapers and such I gather it's not necessary thing going to to drive you in the right direction it's very hard to know about the world and you have to vote you to be careful about this okay so next slide oh yeah I'm going to insist on this don't trust your gut this is extremely important and it's very hard but there are lots of things about the way conditions work that are very wrong very well-known so-called cognitive biases that we have which tend to overestimate things that are familiar with us like things that we that come easy to our mind we tend to like things that are familiar to us there are many things that are very wrong with the way we think and especially when it comes to moral philosophy or where it comes to knowing about the world in general like these kinds of knowledge are extremely hard to have so again don't trust your gut with that so what do you do if you don't trust your gut what can you use so fortunately for us there have been a lot of great research that has been done to better understand the world and to better understand what should be done to improve to have the most effective actions on the world so I think an important reflex that we should that we should all have is not trust your guts but trust like the og the research that has been done and especially the quality research that has been done especially in terms of effective altruism there has been a lot of very good research that has been done especially in terms of like global health this is the World Health Organization of course but like also in different areas like constant that this Association called the start he called giveWell which is a meta charity which is not a strategy that tries to do directly good it's a chart that tries to quantify the goods that other charities are doing so it's a very interesting report and it's a very non-trivial thing it's something that if you go with your Gertz probably you're not going to find the right HRG that has the most benefit beneficial impacts like for instance one interesting thing that Peter Zenger discusses discusses in his book is the fact that for instance that the Rockefeller Foundation that tries to give advice to people who - - to people who want to give her money then give advice advice about which charity that should give money to and one of the classic measures is how much does a charity spend on administrative stuffs like on on itself basically and this is actually a very bad measure because if you look at give well what all the money that you give to give well is spent on administrative stuffs like no no this has a direct impact but I would argue that giver is doing much more good than most charities if not all charities it's not because you're spending money on yourself that you're not going to doing a lot of good so there's also this great resource it's a web site a blog and podcast as well which I highly recommend which is called 80,000 hours and it's based on the observation that there's only so much good you can do if you only do it part-time or if you only do it on on weekends and actually the most effective way to do a lot of good is to make it basic in your career now this sounds like a huge sacrifice I probably like it's a life we need to spend my whole career doing good and being at least once and that that's not necessarily that much of of a cost necessary because most careers that are advised by 80,000 hours are not like bad careers they're just careers like that's hard high-impact and usually they also careers that are very good for yourself like their other careers that's already enjoyable that's also an important part and will be discussed in this later on and all the resources are not going to present them all but basically try to seek for the right for the quality information that tries to to think in terms of of this quantitative effective altruism ideas now all of them agree that there are a few key things that makes something importantly something that's it that deserves effective altruism to kill if it's evil twisted you care about and these are the key the three key properties so problem for effective address is going to be important like something that you should care about if it is first of all overlooked this is a bit counterintuitive but if you think about is like phone sundial problems like global warming that you've probably all heard of us or all heard or you've probably all heard of but everybody has heard of it so you're not going to add a lot to the whole there's already a huge amount of money and people who are trying to to fight this so your contribution is going to be one more contribution to something that's already been big as opposed to a table many areas that are overlooked was not many people are working only on this so typically if there's an area with only 10 people working on this then by starting to work on this yourself you're adding a lot 10% of of the manpower so this is important to treat you to care about things that are overlooked because you're going to have a much greater impact if you start to be focusing on these problems another important aspect is impactful as like you want to have actions that are going to affect a lot of people if you're doing a lot of work to affect only one person it's only one person if you're doing the same amount of work but affecting millions of people is going to have a much bigger impact in terms of effective at risk twisdom is going to be much more effective the third thing is tractable acceptability you want to take actions to focus on plans that are solvable you don't want you to to facepalm data that you have no strategy to to face them ideally you should have a plan and and have an idea of how likely this plan is to be doing good so based on this criteria this has led a lot of effective altruists to identify three key three main lines of of priorities for active altruism the first one is poverty and disease the reason for this is that usually there are lots of problems especially in developing countries that can be sued that can be solved with very little amount of resources and this is because these are poor countries so like any d'Oro you give to them makes a big difference this is one of the main reasons why poverty and disease are so important to effective altruists especially about when you it's about giving money like usually money is going to have a much greater impact if you're giving it to fight poverty or diseases another important line of priority for effective altruists is animal suffering so basically today we are killing billions of animals and torturing billions of animals to have food every year so I don't know the exact figures but it's really huge like it's a huge amount and especially in industrialized farms there's a lot of suffering of animals and you also want to fight that and there's not that much money that is already given to to fight this and you find alternatives and the third important thing is if existence of risk these are long-term risks of huge catastrophes if not destruction of humanity and there are few that have been identified as as key and we'll be discussing this later on ok another thing that effective at risky I guess most nearly all agree with is that if you want to have effective impacts on the world your efforts needs to be sustainable it's usually not good if you just do indeed something once and forget about it so the one of the important aspects especially if you make it your career is to come back again and again to these kind of problems and to really work hard on them year after year and this has interesting pity implications mostly the fact that it's very important for effective altruists to take care of themselves it sounds selfish at first that's why I'm effective altruistic so that I can take care of myself but it's actually very an important part because you cannot be sustainable you cannot sustain your I fault if you don't like doing this effort and that's why I like does this classic idea if you bring a twist it means like individual sacrifice we're not necessarily like it's not necessary sacrifice for yourself actually it's not desirable if it's too big of a sacrifice for yourself you should try to plan actions that are effective but still makes you happy actually even better if it's your actual twist actions makes you all the more happy you should aim at this in fact much of the book of Peter Singer insist on this effective altruists are usually very happy to be a fatal twist if you're doing it I'll twist actions and you're not happy to do them you're probably doing it wrong you should try to to find happiness in what you're doing so that it's sustainable that's important another important aspect is motivation because it's like sometimes we have this day why you feel like oh I'm going to do something for the world but you get this motivation one day but it's important that this motivation stays because impactful efforts all those that can last so it's extremely important to cultivate as well as this motivation it shouldn't be like oh I'm motivated today let's see what role you should plan for being motivated to mojo and one of the important ways the most useful way to do this is to gather as a community that's why I'm so happy that you so many of you it's important you have a whole community that supports you that that defends your your motivation and that helps you keep this motivation to be doing good all the important aspects of taking care of yourself is taking care of what you can do so you're going to be much more effective if you have a lot of skills you have a lot of power you have a lot of influence and you should work on this as well so usually like the first step that 80,000 I was advised to especially young people is to study and specially study things that are hearts usually like mathematics come to a sense that's like that because these are skills that are rare and that are going to be extremely useful likely to be very useful in the future so you should work on your skills you should work on your knowledge it's very important to cultivate this knowledge about the whole world and what are the important programs and so on so you should try to be curious if you want to be effective edge which you should try to to know about the world especially trying to find happiness in in learning about the world and as well like diplomas and influence networking these are things that are important even though they don't sound that sound very selfish and in some sense they are really selfish I guess but they are extremely useful for effective altruism as well so it's not because something is selfish that is not an effective altruism move so we take care of yourself this is a really important part of effective altruism and another important part of effective altruism is making sure that people that are doing effective altruists actions are as well happy motivators give food and so on so there's a whole important aspect of effective altruism which is just supporting and taking care of all the effective altruists and also like soon-to-be aspiring effective our twist as I hope you guys are today okay so so this concludes the first part about effective altruism now I'm going to put down the heart because I'm going to talk more about ideas that are possibly more controversial within the effective altruism community which is I'm going to take this very seriously I think this is really the most important like very important in fact I'm going to make it a claim and my claim is that promoting effective altruism is an effective altruism priority what do I mean by that well if you were to do a lot of like we don't Korea are giving a lot of money and so on well you would be doing some amount of good but imagine now that you convinced two people to do the career you would be doing then you would we have done twice as much good it's as simple as that this is a basic idea and you can scale it up that's the interesting part so actually promoting a is not I'm going to size modify it I'm going to replace it by large scale promotion of effective altruism because now if I can somehow convince all of you guys I don't know exactly how many you are but like thirty people let's say to do effective altruism like x 30 do not I could have done if I was working order myself and large scale promotes more protein you can do even more and I think that this problem of scaling up the promotion of effective altruism ideas is something that is actually overlooked itself it's something that can there is hugely impactful so if I can convince a thousand people to adopt a effective altruism ideas or million people to adopt effective altruism ID ideas then the impact will be huge extremely huge and it's also somehow much more tractable than it seems I would argue and the reason where I argue all of this is because of YouTube so has probably many of you know I'm a youtuber right now we own YouTube as well and other YouTube channels or I'm not the biggest channel at all quite happy with how big I am I'm very fortunate that I'm that happy that big I have at a hundred thousand or 140 thousand subscribers so it's due to a lot of work and so on but there are other people like me who have similar amounts of subscribers if not ten times more 100,000 subscribers a hundred thousand people this is huge this is absolutely huge the amount of good that a hundred thousand people can do as opposed to me alone is vastly more like is hugely more and this kind of impact it's quite common on YouTube like I'm not as not a big youtuber or not the dog many people have much stronger impacts than I am now I don't want to focus too much on these guys I want also to talk about the many youtubers who only have a hundred subscribers because a hundred subscribers is still a huge amount of subscribers it's more than the number of people in this room right now if you can communicate ideas to a hundred people it's huge it's extremely huge you don't need to be a big youtuber to have a strong your huge impact so that's why like caring about social medias in general but YouTube in particular which has disability because one thing that's particles YouTube you also find it in podcast but YouTube and podcast you get to get the attention of the audience for much longer like if you on Twitter or snapchat or Instagram it's like one pause like it's a few seconds of attention if you go on on YouTube or even know in podcast podcast so amazing for this you can get the attention of someone we walk through the ideas the complex ideas for instance of a 50 that reason for for 10 minutes for if not for hours sometimes that's why these medias are particularly efficient at spreading the ideas complex ideas like ideas of effective altruism sorry I think betting on communication on YouTube is something that's really overlooked I think there's not enough discussions about this it's hugely impactful and it's quite attractive world it's not that hard to have 50 subscribers and sounds we trust you have 50 subscribers but 50 subscribers is huge and still do not okay in fact it's so huge that I want to show you a video by one of my colleagues he's a youtuber so I guess he's a colleague of mine [Music] [Music] families choose to have less children and this effect is very very traumatic we find that in every country of the world this is repeated the population growth goes down as we grew help so we take that chart that shows the global population growth and we matching spending it out all the way to 2100 and we can see that in step continuing it actually pops out another way to see that is through this rate of population growth you can see that in the sixties that reached a pretty high number over two percent per year and it's now come wait wait and out now a lot of building people still a lot but the good news is that the vastly improved health the bastard family size Goes Down and so we can feel great about saving those lives yes so what I found well the content of the video is of course very interesting but what I find really amazing with this example is that we're here we have the richest one of the richest guys in the planet one of the most effective altruists in the planet he's giving so much money like billions of the wrath of course and these guys is really thinking about how to do the most good in the world and what does he do he does a youtube channel and what is this YouTube channel but it's about explaining ideas and facts about the world it means that this guy sees that this is what his time and his thumb is worth billions of dollars Latorre so I think this really shows that the importance that at least Bill Gates gives to Communications on YouTube and I think much more attention should be given to quality information and communication on YouTube specially given that educational youtubers are not very well off well I'm doing fine I'm not complaining at all like I have a job at UK sorry it's absolutely great but another one is Bill Gates what we get is doing fine also but I have a lot of friends who have struggled for years and are still struggling to make a living on YouTube even though they have hundreds of thousands of subscribers it's a bit crazy I had these guys who are doing an amazing amount of good and some of them are hesitating to shut down their YouTube channel because they don't have sustained funding like even I I have a one-year contract here like not I'm not complaining of course but like many of my own life I have a lot of youtuber friends like even a month ago had a youtuber friend having his girlfriend I think who had this 200 thousand YouTube subscribers YouTube channel where he's explaining statistics and important ways of doing like do the tricks of Statistics and the pitfalls you should not fall into that really important aspects that we are teach we think about with some ideas like there are the starting blocks of effective altruism well he's not an offensive all twisted himself but yeah his videos have a strong positive impact and he had well he had troubles financially he had to separate with his co-authors like the people he was running the channel week and now he's starting his own YouTube channel and it was really precursor and it was like he was he almost created YouTube and he was doing so much good I think it's such a shame in terms of envy effective altruism that these guys who are doing so much good have do not have a sustained funding and I can give a lot of it are many examples of all the kinds of YouTube channels well not like well like financially it's literally weekend's like they sort of manage it but it's not that's sustained it's not that we're showing so coach goes I can I'm sure like some of you know is called gazecki it's one of these huge YouTube channel but there are many people working for you for Kozak so I don't really know how they're doing financially but it's an interesting example because it's a very successful YouTube channel that that addresses a lot of difficult topics and does it that does it extremely well like it's very amazing what they're doing if you don't know them reach check them out but also many of them in the team that well it's not as many times like they were asking for monies from their subscribers so it's finite if the subscribers are managed to make such to give sustain funding but like they surely are like other words to make this kind of funding more sustained sustainable and more we are showing for people who are running these so other channels like these channels are very amazing like I strongly recommend them all gigantic is thinking she's one of I think she's the best thinker in the world like a she she really is amazing at thinking clearly and and debating well like a strongly recommend of YouTube channel Robert Mize is doing videos on a is safety and specifically for AGI so also a great channel a lot of amazing contents and so on he started at some point on his own asks of money from from followers it should be should be simpler like the thing is that we see those that succeed but there are so many that did that did not succeed and that had to create YouTube have a side job because that did not have sustained funding and there's this new YouTube channel hot mess with PBS who who who started a new channel is about climate change like PBS also had a YouTube channel called PBS infinite series and they had to shut it down it's such a shame because this was such a good top quality channel so for French speakers are also great YouTube channels that I'm going to recommend quickly and like again all of them financially like it's always the question whether you grow profession or full-time and so knowing that it's a partner I think in terms of effective altruism the impact these guys have a huge and could be huge right they were full-time on these kinds of projects so a more fabulous is about a lot of psychology it's very important to understand psychology because we have a lot of cognitive biases and it's very important to understand them to correct them again motor is about thinking clearly risk alpha but statice can revive a about climate change ultimate from this and the reason why these are very important is that on YouTube you have a lot of quality but you have also the exact opposite you can find everything on YouTube and so if you to search for vaccination kills instance on YouTube then for sure you're going to find one video that confirms your intuition in fact you're going to how to find dollars earns and dozens and dozens of videos that goes in your direction YouTube is has everything so whatever you think you can find something on YouTube that is going to advocate for what you think in a better way than you would and indirect the opinions and drives the opinions of the people of how people in a way that is like massive very very massive and today the entire anti-vaccine movement is absolutely huge and this has a lot of huge consequences and somehow we need mentor to fight this but it's extremely hard to fight this just to give you an idea of the scale of the problem so there was this article on the Guardian that that claims that that there were 41 thousand cases of measles in the in 2017 in the six first months of 2017 and it claims that it was the double of two thousand worried this is earlier 2018 and was the double of two thousand of the holy of 2017 so this means that there are about 20,000 so over the year maybe 50,000 something a lot more cases of measles and and like many of them are deadly so here we're talking about skills that that's a huge check tens of thousands of people dying and this is really a beginning like it could go bigger and then we starting and if you think about this numbers like maybe hundreds of thousands of people if we just let it go in the next few years this is like huge huge huge it starts to compare with like the the most deadly diseases in the world what the most deadly one one of the most deadly depends what you call a disease but one of the most deadly that ever give a twister often talk about is malaria which kills 700,000 people every year so and we're starting to get numbers that or nowhere near 700,000 yet but they start to be big and they can be fought quite easily just make people vaccine attack vaccinate people it's a social that we already have and that's not very costly so and I think that YouTube has a big role to play in this so why do I think that YouTube has a big role to play this is because one thing that's probably overlooked is the fact that today if you look at YouTube every minute there are four million views on YouTube and this is interesting it's interesting to compare this with the number of your Google searches today of 3.7 million Google searches at every minute this means that there are more views on YouTube then searches on Google people are more influenced by what they view on YouTube then by what they search on Google and the thing that's even more concerning is the fact that most views on YouTube more than half of the views on YouTube recommended views our views that all suggested by the YouTube algorithm so you know when you go to youtube you have these suggested videos on the right you also if you go to the YouTube homepage you have suggested video these are recommended videos and most videos that people watch videos that are given to them by the YouTube algorithm by the YouTube recommender system so people no longer search for information people don't search for information they get the information that they receive and they receive this information more often than not from the YouTube recommender system and the YouTube recommender system is great amazing at making you addicted addicted to YouTube like it that's why so the YouTube today the YouTube algorithm system is designed as far as I understand anyone which is not very open about this but there are a few papers about this well YouTube is maximizing at least that's what people say is maximizing watch time it's trying to get you to watch YouTube as much as possible this is part of the whole economy of attention where today like the thing that company is one from you is to get you to know about them and you get you get you get our attention to sell us so that you can consume ads and so on and so today attention is a huge part of the economy and every company is fighting to get your attention and YouTube is doing it better than everybody and maximizes your retention it wants you to stay on your on YouTube and the strategy is going to use to get you to stay on YouTube are not necessarily by showing into videos you really wanted to to you have seen the best part is quite often to get to show you videos that will make you addicted you to some topic and and the topic and all few topics that are extremely addictive politics everything about conspiracy theories these are really addictive videos and that's why if you're a new comer to YouTube if you open a new account on YouTube and go to the recommended page the first videos that are going to recommend to be recommended you're going to see a lot of this conspiracy on your videos a lot of empty bags videos because these are videos like people who start to watch and they stay just keep watching these kinds of videos so it's a good strategy for YouTube to recommend this title these videos because he has a huge probability of getting you to stay on YouTube so what I'm saying is that the the the world of YouTube each time has polish with very bad consequences in terms of effective altruism offenses so this leads me to to modify my claim number one if I want to promote effective altruism idea as much as possible the big bottleneck is not youtubers is the YouTube algorithm system the recommender system and YouTube's AI is able to nudge people in one direction or another and I would argue that it should be a priority for effective at risk to get YouTube to nudge users towards something like effective at with some videos how it's actually a priority today this is an action that has small cost more effort and huge impact it can potentially impact billions of people almost instantaneously and over time if you get used to these effective altruism ideas you have much greater chances them yeah see you asking me questions about last impressions I yeah you can ask you questions okay so I'm going to talk about this next yeah so this one part of this is that okay so we should make so I argue should make it YouTube here not towards yay but it's not clear whether this should be public information maybe they should do it in private to avoid controversies okay so the second claim which is ready to much of your question is that doing so is extremely hard this is called the value routine poem actually the name it was introduced by Nick Bostrom it's good value loading is the idea that any artificial intelligence or algorithm whatever you want to call them well you would be better if it has some moral values some human values and you need to load these values into the algorithm and this is a very very hard one how would you argue that is the one of the most difficult crimes that there they are but it's not intractable hopefully it is both technical and non-technical changes one of the non technical challenges is typically if you make it public you say publicly YouTube is going to devalue loading today well it's going to lead to a lot of controversy yes it's a difficult sort of fun now I'm going to insist on why this value loading is very hard it's extremely hard fun and we need to think this carefully you should not try to tweak YouTube right now especially without testing this is a large-scale system so any tweak like it's very bad engineering oh-hoh you shouldn't do engineering by tweeting things you should think it's important we think these clearly and to try to anticipate potential consequences so why is valuating so hard because it's essentially impossible to get it 100% is not even clear what it means to get valuating at 100% but probably it's a machine learning system a machine learning tends to be very good at getting 90% accuracy but you think streaming out to get 99.9999 percent accuracy it's impossible to get 100% and okay so let's assume like we make a youtube video let's say that is right 99.9999 percent of the time let's say it gets something wrong more times out of a million which is extremely good which is much better than most of the things we're doing in a lie by today's standards if we manage to do this it still means that one times out of a million and get something wrong and can get potentially very wrong and this is potentially very bad because the YouTube algorithm system is taking billions of decisions every day only every minute no every day and every day I take billions of decision so if he gets one in a million wrong it still get one thousand decision wrong she's not negligible but it's even worse than that because if people understand the flaws of the YouTube algorithm system they can exploit it like pop for a long time there was this race between the Google like Google was like a recommender like you the answer of most things and you want it to be well ranking on Google so what was this whole industry of so-called SEO optimization like you wanted to maximize your rank on Google so there was this whole game and there's going to be discount of game as well whatever the YouTube is going to do people are going to try to hack it and so the one-in-a-million case that will appear in when we program or AI well maybe it's going to be most cases now because people hackers are going to focus on this case so actually it's not one in a million it could be like fifty percent of the time hackers not going to take advantage of this and this is very hard to anticipate and there needs to be a lot of research on how to to anticipate this and make sure the system is still going to work even if hawkers try to take advantage of the flaws of the system another reason why this is extremely hard is that you could argue there are solutions to these kinds of problems but you are can solve it fine but I need to do this and this like and this and this and that and you could it's very like tempting to say there are a lot of rules that should be followed by the YouTube algorithm system constants the six will be problematic because if you ask to too many constraints then you just going to say no we're not going to do this because it's too constraining I can they have to to deliver a service so it cannot be too constraining you cannot - not too much constraints on the constraints you're going to put on an AI there are constraints to constraints and and like another reason for this is that even if YouTube say okay we're going to apply your system then suddenly YouTube is probably going to be very slow very annoying and people are going to move to another service there's a competition between different areas and if you want the leading edge you'll be value loaded the valuing cannot be too costly otherwise it's going to be overtaken and third reason why valuating is extremely hard is that we are going to disagree about the values to be programmed like even if we're trying to do well we disagree about a lot of things even well-intentioned people disagree and extremely hard to get it right we need to mitigate or disagreement somehow but he takes for me heart because morphine or not we debate on Twitter or Facebook and Twitter and Facebook all extremely flat places to debate like people you really have very bad debates over there but even like in general like family dinners it's not easy to get a debate right and we need to improve the world were debating and to agree that we're not going to agree on everything but we need to find ways to take decisions even when we disagree so all this means that later we both want to claim that solving the value loading problem is a research challenge worthy of some of the next generations best mathematical talent I agree with the fact that it is extremely hard I disagree with both for me in the fact that it's a next generations problem the YouTube algorithm is already there and it needs to be validated I would argue so it's not for the next generation like we should be working right now on how to improve how to solve valuating or at least propose solutions from partially solve it so if I combine my two claims so we needed value loading and by origin is very hard so solving the value regime is actually I would argue today's greatest effective altruism priority we need to know how to program values into algorithmic systems and this is something that I started to think a lot about a few months ago and like so like maybe six months ago something like that in June say way in June I was really worried about this and so I worked a little bit on this and I wrote a paper on the roadmap for the value loading problem which presents both why it is extremely important I think it is today's top priority it also explains what like it has a roadmap like a master plan to how to solve it because it's very difficult and I do not come to solve it at all but I propose solutions to hopefully better structure or to solving this and it also gives a lot of ideas to how to help solving it without doing technical workers without doing your research a third kind that would make have no idea how in some ways it's not long but the third kam that I will make is that solving value loading is also extremely important for tomorrow because so far I've been talking a lot about the yes degrees today like species YouTube recommender system but you can imagine that in the future guys are going to improve in fact they are improving every day so at the pace that is quite unbelievable fine like I'm in the field I'm popularizing the field life I'm trying to talk about the field and instincts to me hard because things are moving so fast and something that was done six months ago can be obsolete by by now it's going very very fast surprisingly fast and so we need to prepare ourselves for future a is like the time is going to take us to solve evaluating as we'll have improved already so we need to prepare solutions for future a eyes and without you we should prepare for the worst-case solutions the worst case settings and the worst case settings could be a is reaching very very high cognitive abilities including human level capabilities in the future maybe in five years or ten years we should be prepared for this even if it's not likely we should be prepared for this first module and we really need this because most analogous that has no way that things go well if we don't solve the value road in Poland yeah good that there's no way around this difficult point and I will go with it like this is like I've tried to think a lot about ways to mitigate the risk without solving the value loading pond and I don't see any so we really should discuss value reading poem as a key priority not only for today but as well for the future I would like you now what can be done about this the first thing to notice is that basically there's essentially today near zero research on value routing like the other thing is related to evaluating but like value routing itself as well as as goal I'm dog you that's not essentially no good research from this time at least there needs to be much more research on this and one reason why there's no research is that there's no funding for this kind of research at least so far like like MIT has announced that it's going to put 1 billion dollars in ethics of AI so maybe it's going to change it a little bit in the coming years but and when the other is great but everyone should try to to fund this and completely not just I'm right here Polly the one who endures is not going to go all into value loading so yeah we need you to care more but what you're doing and to fund this kind of research and we also need to attract talents because there are lots of technical challenges that are extremely hard and you really need the best people working on this part like it's really important that the top scientists work on these kinds of problems and care about these kinds of programs and not only them without you it's important to make this very widespread so like even like like I would argue artists should care more about much more about this planet because if artists care about this problem they can spread these ideas in a manner that no that may be much more efficient than at least orthogonal to do it your purchases that I would be using for instance another thing that's important is to value safety I think this is increasingly thing increasingly the case and it's very good that it's increasingly the case but if you're starting a start-up for instance you're not going to brag about the safety protocols you've put in going to brag about deep learning power base something like that it's important to brag about safety it's important that people who don't brag about safety are around upon something like that and one last thing is to improve debating like we need you to get better at debating these ideas because unfortunately these ideas are quite often extremely poorly debated even by experts of AI there are huge of disagreements between experts of areas that are like debating like like cats and dogs and very badly so we need to be this these ideas much better and just to conclude this talk so there's a Google Form so either you want you motivated enough to write this on your phone or you can go to the events on Facebook you pour your link here somewhere on the on the stage and you cannot so the this form to improve the experience of effective altruism no son I thank you for attention [Applause] just another thing I thought I said that I wanted to talk a bit about the technique altruism movement here because as Lee said one of our top priorities in the effective a through effective altruism movement is to spread effective altruism so that other conference like this can take place so what do we do so one of our our common meetings is a biweekly discussion group that takes place like the third another one will takes place next week we meet at Esplanade around the corner past six and we discuss problems about effective altruism we discussed once about global health and we discussed also especially one of the TED Talks that was in the conference we discussed about one of panics and the existential risks it poses and then we do other activities in the next semester we'll have another career workshop to help people figure out maybe how to to go and have a career that is very fulfilling they talked about that we also have maybe a more in-depth workshop about effective altruism because it's a growing movement it has a lot of complex philosophical basics that one needs to pause up more time to to fully understand with this I invite you to maybe get a drink [Music] [Music] yes a good question and I'm not sure what is the best way to go but like I think that YouTube is very careful about its image and there are actions of the taken by YouTube belongs to Google and if I sense YouTube is very like like a YouTube promoting and civics is not good publicity for YouTube YouTube is trying to invest as well in education educational YouTube so YouTube kind of already cares about this and I think it's important that they see the value of carrying it caring about it at an algorithmic level so I don't have a lot of friends like YouTube Google is that listened to me and that can make a big difference but these ideas need to spread I think like this it should be more okay to be believing these kind of things because whenever I discuss these kinds of ideas to basically anyone the like except from with people I always talk to you but I get used to what I'm saying but most people are very scared by this idea of the idea that you're going to trick the algorithm or get you so it needs to be more okay and for this I think as a first step and then I need a good idea is welcome yeah not sure what is the best way for the value loading from it seems that the way you presented it we still have to load our values into the algorithm which means yeah so it's a very good point if you will do an International Democratic vote it's not Korea's going to go the right way and I would argue like even if you just ask me the values I would put in this algorithm are probably very scary to most even to myself right so it's important to be aware of the limits of our own intuitions of moral philosophy and so what I argue like so that this idea by increased by a little eutychus key which is the idea that we should not load values that are our current values which we should load values that are what we values would be if we had time to better think these ideas through if we remove those cognitive biases and stuff like that so yeah I would argue that this is what should be done and it's very difficult yeah yeah unfortunately we cannot do this well the hope is that maybe with an algorithm systems we can do better than what we think we would think that's so the hope it's raises a lot of interesting forensic nonsense how do you how can you be convinced that like the machine that computed what you would want if you thought longer on how does this machine convince you that it is indeed what you would want if you thought it's a very very difficult for answer and yeah we need to think more about these problems and it's not clear it's tractable what I hope it's try to go in the other question yeah what would the a first-year student okay so I think it's great to start a YouTube channel but don't have the hope to be seen a lot and the reason why it's still great to do a YouTube channel is that it's a place where you have to expand your ideas it's like starting a blog except that the difference is I would argue that doing a YouTube video you spend more time doing the YouTube video than writing a blog and because these guys who write pages and pages of blogs and they don't put like it's way easy to just work without thinking and it's important to write and think are you writing and it's an effort that's very valuable because it it helps you understand what you would want to watch thinking longer so it's kind of a father's very productivity useful to learn as well if you're doing a YouTube channel on on what you're studying like I learned most of what I know by doing YouTube videos or we have to say that yeah it forces you forces YouTube to be more in depth into the material you you're teaching so I'd still think that we need to views or at least like having a blog let's say is valuable for the video and who knows if you're doing it well maybe you can have a good huge impact the track for first is you enter the most important advice is like do well like study well have good grades and learn a lot you're going to be much more valuable and able to do a much bigger impact if you're doing this [Music] well so it's a it's a cost for YouTube financially it's a cost then you could argue that okay so cost for YouTube but yeah come on YouTube is not especially okay Google where it's not like I mean to go bankrupt retro so it's a cost but it's a much greater impact more beneficial impact and like I think a lot of people within YouTube and within Google so that this movie his name I am learning his first thing which is a bit embarrassing but what he quitted Google because he thought what he was doing at Google was not good basically and he gave TED talks about this especially the economy of attention at least YouTube Pro consequences but he argues that actually most people at Google and YouTube have this frame of mind like they they want to do good and they're the water so they don't need you which would be doing bad things it's just that it's not yet taken from granted that so Kate you want to do Google rather than doing what's good for the company but I think this can change we were in situation where most people are sufficiently well often these companies to care about doing good rather than than keeping their positions like like most people are waiting to keep their position in the company or go higher in the company and this is due to incentives and the atmospheres in the company if it changes like I think things can change like I would bet more on Google it's weird thing to say but I would bet more on Google than on many governors like you guys will not and I think I would not be the only one yeah it seems like in order to do promote effective filtration on YouTube we need to so place to some extent the value Laden program right and it is costly so the question is isn't it cheaper to just pay by ads well it's not one or the other you can do both so I don't know how to give the YouTube ads all what I do know is that they don't pay a lot of money to creators but yeah it's an idea I kept committing so there's also a trade-off in the in spreading the ideas of effective altruism because if it spreads too fast and too poorly like just like sharing these ideas very quickly and not in depth they they will easily be misinterpreted if even if you're doing a good job at making a good summary of effective altruism in one sentence and all okay five sentences even if you're doing the best job possible they are going to be a lot of people who misinterpret it so it's very important to be careful about how you do this and there's a trade-off about going fast and keeping the core ideas as clear as clear as possible as well so I think it's not necessary we are yet to present these as effective altruism ideas you can just present things that how to think more clearly about this topic how to question your moral intuitions something that unless no question okay so thank you for attention [Applause]
