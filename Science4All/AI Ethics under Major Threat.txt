hi all this is the first time in eight years that some current event felt so important to me that i feel the need to discuss it on my channel in english what i'm going to talk to you about today seems even more important to me than coveted 19. we are going to talk about the dismissal of dr timmy cabu co-director of google's ai ethics team and a renowned academic researcher so there are still a lot of unknowns in this story largely because each side is trying to protect itself legally but the tldr of my understanding in which i have an enormous credence is that the google management censored a publication by its ai ethics team that is something deeply worrying because as i've discussed it at length on my channel and as it's discussed at much greater length in our book lu fabulous it has arguably become urgent to think about the ethics of the algorithms from google and other tech companies because they are used by billions of humans on earth as a result they inevitably greatly influence the information to which billions of us will be exposed on a daily basis but there is some good news in all of these and even a great news following teammate kobo's dismissal google employees wrote a collective open letter protesting the dismissal and demanding three things from the management one more explanation about the censorship of the publication two more transparency towards the general public including you and me three a unique oracle commitment to research integrity and academic freedom and respect for the principles of google's research philosophy and google's ai principles at the time i am filming this video the letter was signed by a total of 2040 google employees and 2 658 individuals from academia industry and civil society and among them there is me so 2040 is a lot but google is almost of a hundred thousand employees so it's still a small fraction of all of google's employees and as for 2658 well this is almost disappointing what i'd like is for these numbers to be at least in the orders of the tens of thousands so the main reason i'm making this video is to try to convince more of you to support the open ladder not only to support teammate gabru whose dismissal took place under very strange conditions especially in the opinion of her own manager who found out about it after the fact but also and above all to support research and discussions on the ethics of algorithms not only at google but also in the other companies in the academic world and beyond yes because this letter is not a reaction to a simple news item it is a reaction to a censorship of research on the ethics of the world's most sophisticated and influential algorithms today google search responds to billions of queries per day and youtube recommendation algorithm is responsible for 70 of the billions of videos views on the platform in other words two times out of three when an individual watches a video it's because youtube's algorithm recommended that video however numerous researches show that the impact of this algorithm has long been catastrophic with conspiracy theories that make millions if not billions of cumulative views videos that deny climate change that make almost as many views as those that explain it and content that propagates dangerous public health misinformation conversely high quality videos could make a lot more views if google were more willing to promote reliable information recently at google there have been a lot of ethical progress such as the recruitment of teammate gobu in 2018 the investment in the ai ethics team she has built the many academic publications of this team or even the prestigious fairness accountability transparency conference which teammate gabriel helped to create and which is organized by the acm the international association for computer science research but more generally all these signals have certainly helped to create a culture within google that makes researchers and engineers aware of the risks of their algorithms and that puts pressure on google's management as was the case when engineers refused to collaborate with the us military to some extent these ethical advances have been validated by the addition of banners during the coving 19 crisis that redirects to wikipedia or to the world health organization website or by the external audit of different groups or researchers that show that youtube decreased the recommendation of dangerous misinformation on some topics however according to these papers this is still largely insufficient and we need a lot more investment in the ai ethics and safety teams at google but at least we should recognize that there has been some clear progress including collaborations with external academics to study the social impacts of google's algorithms as in the case of the famous publication by timmy gabu and her colleagues which seems to have been accepted initially by google's management however teammate gabriel's dismissal seriously undermines this culture of ethical responsibility above all it sends the wrong kind of signals to every google employee don't question our products or you will be fired it is critical that there be a proportionate response to this horrible signal in my opinion so far the response is good but it is not yet proportionate in order for it to be proportionate it is critical that this operator get a lot more support from a lot more people both from inside google but also from outside this is our opportunity to tell google that our concerns about their algorithms cannot be swept under the rug to demand more transparency and above all to much more value the security and ethical dimensions of their algorithms given the influence that google's algorithms have today and the concerns to be had on the quality of the information disseminated on the internet it seems to me that this is critical for the future of humanity in fact the signal that we are sending through this letter should not be limited to google it is also an opportunity to tell the management of other companies facebook twitter amazon microsoft or apple that the ethics of their algorithms must be taken very seriously and that any concerns raised internally or externally must be treated with care and respect it is also an opportunity to tell all computer science researchers that improving the performances of the algorithms they design should not be the main concern even today it is much cooler and much more valued to discover a new algorithm that solves the problem faster than previous algorithms or to show that some implementation can achieve performance according to some metric by a factor 1.5 than to raise and solve ethical issues with this or that deployment of this or that algorithm such papers on ethics or safety are much more easily rejected by peer review and the researchers involved in them will therefore have fewer job opportunities to stay in the academic world more generally we are currently giving very bad incentives to public research finally this open letter is an opportunity to tell other researchers from other disciplines that if they do themselves research on the ethical issues of algorithms on social networks they will be listened to and not ignored or sued by organizations like google in particular it seems critical to me that research in ethics be done both by google researchers who analyze algorithms and data that only google has and which are difficult to share for privacy reasons but also and especially this research should be done outside of google too where academic freedom will make it easier to criticize google's products and thus to avoid some ethics washing that is unfortunately way too common these days making large-scale algorithms robustly beneficial is a fabulous endeavor but to initiate it it is urgent that we show that we care enough about it and the best way to do this today is surely to sign the open letter whose link is in the description
